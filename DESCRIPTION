Description: This package provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for RNA-seq 
    data differential expression (DE), differential alternative splicing (DAS) and differential 
    transcript usage (DTU) analyses based on two popular pipelines: limma and edgeR. The 3D 
    RNA-seq GUI is based on R shiny App and enables command-line-free analysis. To perform 
    analysis, the first step is to generate transcript quantification from quantification tools, 
    such as Salmon and Kallisto (1-2 Days). Then users can do mouse click on the App to upload 
    transcript read counts, perform DE and DAS analysis, and make beautiful plots, e.g. expression 
    mean-variance trend plots, PCA plots, heatmap, GO annotation plots, etc. (1 Day or less). The 
    pipeline has steps of proper data pre-processing and false positive controls. These lead to 
    robust 3D predictions. All the results and plots can be saved to a report in html, pdf or 
    word format. The analysis pipeline has been successfully used in different RNA-seq studies 
    from Arabidopsis, barley and potato.
